# Named Entity Recognition using bidirectional LSTM model

Performed Named Entity Recognition on the CONLL 2003 News dataset using a bi-directional LSTM model trained using both random embeddings and GloVe embeddings. Achieved an F1 score of 81 and an accuracy of 95.96% on the dev set when training the model using randomly initialized embeddings. Achieved an F1 score of 89 and an accuracy of 97.85% on the dev set when training the model using GloVe embeddings.
